WIP -  toy project (Actix web - Vue.js - Keycloak)
The aim is to have a todo list that's self-hosted with a social aspect (joined notes between users)

Setup to self-host :
- create an .env from the local .env.
- docker compose up
- wait for the keycloak to be launched, create the rusty_notes realm and the main user admin of the realm
configure the realm also with front url, groups
